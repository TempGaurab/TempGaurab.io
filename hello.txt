                <p>
                    As a dedicated member of the search committee for the Assistant Professor position within the School of Computing and Analytics at Northern Kentucky University, I offer a valuable student perspective to the evaluation process. Collaborating with Professor Zhou, Professor Caporusso, Professor Fox, Professor Cho, and Professor Jiang from the College of Informatics at NKU, my role as a student reviewer allows me to provide insights into the qualities that make an effective educator. I am committed to ensuring that prospective faculty members not only excel in their scholarly pursuits but also possess the ability to create an engaging and supportive learning environment. Upholding NKU's vision of a student-ready, regionally engaged university that prioritizes inclusiveness, equity, and global awareness is central to my mission.
